# Linear Algebra 
Linear algebra is the branch of linear equations mathematics that uses vector space and matrices.

The two primary mathematical entities that are of interest in linear algebra are the vector and the matrix. They are examples of a more general entity known as a tensor. Tensors possess an order (or rank), which determines the number of dimensions in a matrix required to represent it.

- vectors: A set of numerical elements of a particular size and one-dimensional.
- Matrix: A set of vectors that form a rectangular structure with rows and columns. For example:
